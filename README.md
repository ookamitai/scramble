# Scramble - A terminal display API for Rust

## Getting Started

Just add this line in your `Cargo.toml` file.

_I didn't bother uploading this crate to crates.io because this is only a learning project._

``` toml
[dependencies]
scramble = { git = "https://github.com/ookamitai/scramble.git" }
```
